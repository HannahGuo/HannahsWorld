## C4-K3
A Terasology World created for Google Code-in 2019. Inspired by cake.

Note: GCI Task 3 is located on the plugin branch: https://github.com/HannahGuo/HannahsWorld/tree/plugin

Also, in the World Generator Preview, it may appear to be a black screen. However, if you turn your screen brightness up and look carefully, there will be some white patches where there are hills :)

#### Features:
- **7 New Blocks!** I couldn't find blocks textures that I liked... so I made my own.
- **White Icing Hills** Smooth...
- **Rainbow Sprinkles!** Coloured candy blocks are randomly generated in the world. 
- **Candles!** Candles are also spawned randomly in the world.
- **Dark Candy Chunks!** Also spawn randomly in the world.
