### Hannah's World
A test plugin world for Google Code-in 2019!

Note: this world is meant to be a plug-in of another World Generator, rather than a standalone World Generator. However, if you try to preview it as a World Generator, you may see a black preview screen. Turning up your screen brightness and looking closely will reveal white blotches where the hills are. :)

Theme: Ores from the Core

### Features:
- Torches

Massive torches have exploded onto the surface! No one knows why they're so big...
- Ores

Scattered among all the stone, you can find diamonds, gold, iron and copper. All you have to do is look; no mining required!
